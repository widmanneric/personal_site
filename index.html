					&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a senior software engineering student at Michigan Technological University working as a full stack developer at 24G LLC in Troy Michigan. Most of my experience in commercial software development has leaned on web technologies, however I am not foreign to native development having completed projects for Android and OSX. Aware of the controversy, my favorite programming language is JS. With technologies like Node.js runtime and the constantly evolving ECMA specifications advancing the languages expressiveness, improvments are frequent and ongoing. JS has contracted a suffusive property as consequence of the IOT trajectory so evident in the tech world, and that expansive condition in addition to its ease of use and improving concision are reasons I'm willing to place much of my stock into it.<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;In my free time I enjoy reading literature which for the past few years has consisted of primarily "classics", Lawrence, Joyce, Steinbeck, Woolf ect. Although I'm inconsistent at best, I enjoy writing as a creative outlet - but aside from brief flashes of success, I do not seem to possess the iron volition needed to chug through dry spells - a trait arguably universal among great writers. I'm a lover of outdoor activities frequently cycling, hiking, and kayaking throughout the week.<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of this website is to archive my various works including personal research, essays, and creative writing - along with any other activity I find worthy of documenting and sharing.<br><br>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;Landscapes are never captured well on bad cameras by uneducated photographers. Days after, looking at the photos I've taken, leaning on them as a physical retention of a brief moment, I'm left with only a flattened resemblance. There is a decrease in the potency of what during experience was a visual stimulus, and I think it has to do with perspective and a pictures lack of texture. <br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;That tangent aside, I'm quite surprised how well everything went. I have never been solo backpacking before and things went without a snag. The drive was fine, the hike was enjoyable, and the drive home was fine - a three step process. It's really spooky how fine things were, especially considering the certain anxiousness I had before making a sporadic decision to purchase 700 dollars worth of ultralight hiking gear and go wander 25 miles in the woods. But i'll be damned if it wasn't anything but therapeutic and mildly challenging. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing particularly interesting happened. It rained the first night, the birds chirped, the butterflies flew, and my back hurt a little. Nevertheless as I wavered deeper into the experience, and the world of rattling highways left my mind, as my thought became blank and my body a machine built to push forward, I attained a supersense of myself and the barren dunes around, knowing my sloven meatbag as it rolled down the sands to be an akward attachment to me. What ensued is best described as a dissociative experience, not in the sense of leaving, rather collapsing into a single point.

					&nbsp;&nbsp;Though fleeting, as cruel time tends to do to itself and us in it, for these times in the dunes, woods, archipelagos, and beaches I was alone in the world; not in the way of loneliness, not in the way we feel bound to a place or person unfree, in a way I find myself trapped by the realities that so persistently remind me of them, of alimentation real and imagined, rational and irrational, not melancholy or joyous, but a blank alone, a peaceful solitude of my reality and mentality. I was not worried of any vanity, any prickling trifle so abundant in normal life, I was not even strung on the inconsistent comforts which are clung too in everyday life - I was a panting animal, challenged and plain. While occurring it was not spectacular or even a forefront of thought, as I became a singular thing without a body or mind, just a breath on the breeze. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;How easy it is to abandon prosaic disposition and recline into poetic indulgence. Not two paragraphs prior and 12 hours earlier I am quoted, "Nothing particularly interesting happened", and somehow I've warped that negation, that nothing interesting into something interesting. This is why I am attracted to minimalism, in a spinning world a purity of plainess becomes exotic, a soothing spice tricking the tongue to its misunderstood sleights. The question is then with this new found like, is it sustainable? As it is moving away from me in time, I grow fond to reach it, whereas during its impact, it was inconsequential, meaningless if not enjoyable. Its effects are unnoticable now, blunted by carbon monoxide fumes at the intersection, only inaccurate re-creations in my synapses. (See pic below for flat image of dismal synapses)

					&nbsp;&nbsp;When I doggedly trudged the final miles to my car Tuesday night, and sit here today Friday with an uncertain malaise, a fatalistic haunting, what can I really take from experience? Whatâ€™s really left from these periods? A photograph, a false aphorism to grasp, a re-creation from language of the ineffable? Or am I forever trapped in the present, the only reliable thing to manipulate justly, the only thing I can hope to understand, the only thing in which I can once again become a panting animal plain and free. [Soft and Sweet?]
