                    &nbsp;&nbsp;“It is possible for every phenomenological concept and proposition drawn from genuine origins to degenerate when communicated as a statement. It gets circulated in a vacuous fashion, loses its autochthony and becomes a free-floating thesis. Even in the concrete work of phenomenology lurks possible inflexibility and the inability to grip what was originally grasped.” -Heidegger <br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;I know of myself traits, I can approximate some rough image, a loosely bound scaffolding that is present as I drift through. Something of me is not artificial, some solid rod props me into the wind as a sail and lets loose the bits in between to be in contact with the current. Taken by moods to various junctures, thin mountain peaks and dewy valleys, every other bearing there between, dazed sungazing, sleepless nights, I’m set forth here and forever. Sooner I am with a flowing spirit, one captured in a treacherous place, sooner I come to be that which I am. Sooner does the external world become and pass through without resistance. The brick wall beyond my window passable, the thunderous collisions of the sky heard, the bleeding heart left to roll down the hill passionately. I am not a scarecrow on a stick, I am haunted, I feel significant, I feel an importance, superficial existentialism doesn’t define me because I assert myself. <br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;I will the way, living now one can live forever, pushing the center of my fabric and embracing the warm tenderness of its monolith. There’s nothing to forgive because there is nothing to grasp, there is only grasping of the phenomena caprice. I love the existence that consumes me and which I come forth within. I am an appendage dangling from that monolith. Fen ferns dazzle, a clump of stew in the bog rising with mud and a burning star. Chloromonolith magenta, blood pipes from us spirits to granite basalt shelves and piling dirt. Emplacements at repose until the next tick sets to motion. <br> <br>

Recalled from rampart, called to council in the drupes pit for a mutiny guillotine mandolin recital, the salad chopped and mixed. Phantasia spirals off wheeling in karmic batter as a fish fry muddled old fashion glugs down the gut of a midwestern patron bar fly. The foaming mouth stein river, yeasty rising of the starch that spills off the sheets onto bare floor velvet. She gasps and is diffused out into the open room lifted from her dense bastion as to rise through the roof. A jelly orange filling, the donut is a softie not so packed as the yam. Marzipan the doughy caramelization residue on aluminum is dislodged as flaky shavings black while the oven coos for scrap scrapes off the scoop. A bear scratch on bark, greasy venison dribble mercury, steel wool screech on grimy exhaust, the morose roadkill scatter, the footprint cloven, a vat of grease fry boil splatter burns the hand speckled pink on tan meringue lemon pie morning.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Pewter chamber of echos, grating misplucked fret ricochet that fills the ear of paranoia rattle skull compartment. Compartmentalized baskets of unfolded clothes flood out into the open atelier. She flickers through the nonseparation, rolls somewhat as a pig, and is risen in robes of discordance. 
                    <br><br>
                    “Here I am room, prepared for what day may hold. Fitted to the seam no string flutters from I”
                    <br><br>
                    “By dawn’s virgin ray, a spathe overcoat of violet clenches your marigold figure, your boisterous fashioning begets the appliances and other matters cheerful embrace”
                    <br><br>
                    “Room I come to bearing this morn’, your interpenetration goes not without recognition and your remarks fall not on deaf ears but those attentive and thoughtful. It is oft I take note of your presence and am filled with comfort by the warmth you bring graciously”
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Dehinged into wide open she desteams on a sill clouded with dividends of patient meditation –  retreat into cradling stock in the midbrain. Underfed she mats down roughage in the hide with deliberate licks, each pass distorting bristiling pastry with chewy mastication. Calcium saliva soaks the bready surface to silt swept up as light illuminates wafting specs; shaken from otherwise unmoved holdings, they are aerated into jirating dancers resettled elsewhere as reanimations layed down onto earth. Newly a’fresh and set, Marzipan begins venture into city sheen, the impressive metropolis of grandeur with polynomials cubic as the most impressionistic representations of fruit bowls. Fruit cake heaped onto the ground like upchuck of a homeless staggering belligerent, he ponders the sunny side up he huffed and the tone in each drifters hiccup. As he did nothing more than stand he was afflicted by involuntary knots of the intestines wrapping senselessly in his abdomen.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Marzipan opens the brass doors and slides into marble innards. She sorts out the desires pretzeled complexity as the operating tricky cogs inside of a pocket watch. Underneath the fine embroidery glaze delicacy an inedible grafting structures mechanical thrust toward nothing well defined like time. Serpentined belted it slips on the bearing loosened. Deliberations wizzing, woebegone halcyon, Zankapfel broth steeps on blossoming mandrels spun: the brain, loin, and heart transmuted from taciturn gravy into senses. Oleander juices flow over foil keeping oil from being burnt into noir graphite blemishes.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Marzipan presses the lift button to call for its hoisting, descending from the heights it moves in opposition. At the first floor golden incisors seperate to welcome her to the cities vascular shafting, a metaliphagic contrapuntal shimmying, an art deco happening – pneumatic tube suction displacement, depitted and pimentofied in brine conveyer tumble – OleaMarzipan turns inside out and flips wildly through the tunneling. Polymetis veining lit in heliocopernican shine dispelled of splenda, the gorge sloshes as silver puddles that ensnare, venus fly trap chaining, cluttered grazing Gray street, flailing feet drag, saline solution contamination of oversalted shortcake, rotten egg whites mineralized in shell, carbonoids brownian in pipeline flogged in netting, dragged from the mariana to heights laid bare a variegated adulteration, tainted olive bread. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Black mold on petri drywall overhang, a squalid bundle pollinates the lung buzzingly off the rattling water spout. Turkey vulture lunch meat gathers as salmonella on pink gelatin pyrographed to unkept cutting boards, tissue pulverised to shepards pie squash, autumnal death hummock plump and pulsating at harvest. Aromatic wafting of burning leaf float so she may lie a cadaver encircled in the amphitheater nonsterily mishandled bare fist. Arsenical bronze plating of the conjoined concubine for feast by the poioumena, ravishment of Marzipan into solidified gristle solder. Stiff staked and unincubated OvoMarzipan is drained of yoke onto the griddle tin an omelette served with black coffee and unwanted grind rock tumble. Men of distinction dine behind newspapered colitis hemorrhoids to the satisfying scintillation of hashbrowned re-fry. Svitlana pours a new one unappreciated and thinking of the old country, the diner a time capsule of evanescent break fasters reappering then vanishing into suberbia to do who knows what. A measly jangle of coin piled to show for it and a lost morning everyday for unending years streaming like floury pancake mix. Some fellow of extreme paleness and untamed hair marches through the glass door refusing to make eye contact with strangers and arrives at the table of his presumed acquaintances. 
                    <br><br>
                    “Erin, what the actual fuck is going on with your hair”
                    <br><br>
                    The lankey one laughs at the foreign ones trite but unavoidable comment.
                    <br><br>
                    “I, Son of Erin, slayer of Nephilim, green seedling of the nobel rising pastures of the gaelic homestead, outcasted thirteenth member of the ruling class, betrayed by my own blood a bastard arrive here valent to strike you a’fowl”
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    A rotten wormed apple dusk gray unsheathes from the worn pocket of Erin’s mismatching beige utility pants. Erin Paris hulks the innocent fruit with such exertion onlookers are certain he tore the sinew of his misshapen shoulders. On impact a stack of potatoes near the griddle reveal from entrails a snowy white brethren befitted with ivy tendrils of life giving suction. The uncolored germ evading notice of Erin, Svitlana, and the newspaper men alike extends its libidinous root achingly toward the gooy remains of Marzipan defiled. Dried to a crisp Marzipan thinks herself a refined Danish women of delectability sauteed in contrasting sausage oil pop, putrid green onion chive for ligaments cotton soft on the homicidal short order cook assembly line. At its destination the serpent slurps the fettered Marzipan like a silly straw suckle of ungrateful children attending party at Chuck E Cheese omelette. It retreats having achieved the meaning of its existence, returning nutrition to the spud and burying a deposit of zinc in the dorment holdout breathless, the saltine waves on skillet like exhales of the heating duct.

                    I. Compounding
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Conjunctive, the interest accumulates in untapped reveries hidden as in a truck stop the dismal air of contemporary aroma gases dual lungs. One and two collapse unaccompanied by a third without regard. The honey hole yet utilized to darker comportments, undrilled oil spigot.

                    II. Transposing
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The reef beyond the sand does not move in my respect but the waters so lively enveloping it move without obvious forces compelling. Thereby it is of necessity for a movement to pertain to objects of motion. A shadow is cast before the wall and in its length presents motion crude. It is set alive before a backdrop as a blazing example of crystallization. Yet, the entombed crystal sets itself away as a crusted dowager surveys the finer features of a manicured lawn, without great effort and is forgotten on either a finger or porch.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Crooked noses before the mirror and human vanity senselessly butcher the image of a despairing animal. Dysmorphic slouchers straggle the walkways and derelict architecture sifts down into itself. A celled poets lengthy extrusion of rose petals is flung from the meristem at the end of a steaming distortion of air. Soporifics ease the impressions floaty to easier modes of redirection. Burnished burls at the feet of oaks live tirelessly as etchings of grass carpet their spacious yet obstructed space. Littered as the wood, the conscious grows weary of its incongruent edges spilling into a noxious stew of material matter.

                    IV. Diminishing
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Potency is the issue of greatest importance in an impression. February diminishes against the sun dew on the harvard yard. The importance of the local too vanishes in its secret power. Evaporites before a demanding world without replenish, extinction of the amazon, acidification of the oceans, the very personal decay of capacity accompanying time, all a lowering of the general body into despondency. The swelling sore before willow dust, a diminishing is also an alleviation. A mature flavor profile extinguishes the bitter excitements of youthful abundance.

                    Meanwhile in the abode, kitchen countertop granite, rock polish, the tumbler drink mixer, blandishments sugar coated, saltine olive cracker jack, umami seasoning for the season. Whitsuntide niceties tucked neatly, sunday’s best: amass mole, guacamole, sauce on the saucers and flying about blankly. Serve the guest our finest. The good silverware with no marks. Untouched by butane. Borderline personality. The indoor lighting not quite nauseating, cabin fever confounding, but irritating to the forced iris. Spring is a horizon cyclical syrup, coagulates from the nostril, then bodily deterioration.  Narcissus sprouts from the vanity lens, her policy of Laissez-faire nuisance on the coffee table shimmer. Rub the bony shoulder, maybe croak a bit, pass the plate, butternut squash winter fruit. Classic. Presence signified by a fragrance, ripening food the gravity of a room, pulling the lizard brain senses to focus. An orange bowl in foyer, the primitive image on the mind of an artist – attunes the senses to the greater motion. Lounge beneath the door on the rug, spritz of cranberry juice, cleanses the nerves from their discomfort, spine on tile to further satiate the gut.

                    Daffodil, could I describe her? Detailed as a painting and shallow as one too. Connotation a fools trick, the dead stand traffic on 275, heaven a traffic jam on the 405, a three hour standstill morning freeze. The congressmen place pikes across the aisle, Daffodil arises from the deadlock. Flourishing from the cement crack, not infinite but uncountable, Noam Chomsky unable to deduce the number from theorem – binomial nomenclature, latin for an afront. She is not a facade, do not misunderstand, but merely a figment, not of the imagination but of the current fragment. Textually enriched, enriched bread for the prisoners, the beriberi got to the plant eater. Daffodil can produce wine, a Dionysian porridge earth mineral stew. As with many stews untastably scalding but once cooled correctly seasoned. The wino’s wisdom set, berry nuptial to the poison sugar, two drops herbaceous dragon flower, condensed chartreuse green distillation, blinding absinth grass water, galapagos jew ear, sprig of the miners brush, millet, and mystery. A vessel to be filled by solipsism, the ingredient origins impenetrable as appalachia. Cades Cove, the ferns plentiful clash with synthetics. Chemical calligraphy, she is a secondary metabolite, the wastes of the plantae bile lively radiation. From a lick of her temple decussation arises. A stones throw fromage, the messenger of my vigor, the sheath of my desire, delicate dandelion.

                    Dastardly den, strewn into clumps, fungally fragrant green. The hogs sniffer rifling for truffles tangentially sways the underbrush at Hungarian foot falls. Black water, dim resonance, SD cards sparse between the fruiting mush.  In the black forest at the polyethylene peppercorn tree, over the cherry wood desk and glasses rack, over the floor trim beige beams from the philosophers forehead off the flesh pink wallpaper, the glaze fixtures perform binary. Seated stoic, they make number crunching hand movements before an electronic glass wall. Their presence involuntary, they meander down the cliff face with rolling water abstractly and land plainly as boulders before a mountain foot in the underbrush mildew ivy room, winters ravage beyond the pane.

                    Rough around the edges, mildly out of order, spit around, flea in the wind, phalanx ill formed, he galivants around nonsense. Tobacco alfalfa, green brussel sprout, misaligned tooth ache, tonsiled infection, jimmies the handle of his rooms door, dusk inside, bouillon vegetable skin husk. Mildly odor, milky palms, a senseless smirk, morning glory, a cackling presence on dim evenings, retracted, distant  – doesn’t ask questions, doesn’t listen, doesn’t venture beyond the limits of his property, fenced off pen, pen cap latched shut. Walks endlessly without cause, hums poorly, mildew sprouts on the brick wall. Chamomile beer bottle tea a favorite drink – microwaved 1 minute and 23 seconds, 83 notches on the dial spun, an environmental hazard, an irradiated carbon lodging. Tin hut, roof overhead, light through the pinholes warming water, oozes colour. Infamously stuck between imaginary paigns and artificial motivators, constantly blocked, lost amidst the trees. Can listen to the quiet chirps, and air noises from the bathroom pipe. Daydreams in meetings, mollifies trifles with poor maneuver.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    William Dafued the Third looks out on the bay stationary in his navy blue garb woolen and caught on sharp shoulders. He peers toward the horizon, an impressive view from the massive window of a 20th floor office. Shafts glance off dark walnut panels of the agency and produce a blinding glint on the golden brims of his pedagogic spectacles. With woozy stringency in his step and sharpness about the brazen glass he peers at the city and its majesty. Up on his perch, embedded neatly along a cove of tinted windows, the observatorium faces outward where he stands akimbo to the lines of slate cubes dotting the waterfront gripping the beach head in asphalt fingers. Reddish vehicles and faces drip down the charcoal paths sliced from blocks, an unexplained movement of car horns, shouts, and sirens. A place high above the sidewalk, wide eyed ants gawk – their chins pointed to the clouds with praise for the proprietors ensuring the day to day activity of the citadel is without turmoil. Some even go as far as mumbling words of reassurance looking up to the obsidian eye, its black opaque a conformation of transparency ensured by men like Mr. Dafued, their certain interest in the wellbeing of ants. Up winding stairways, the executives leather boat shoes rest on smoke carpeting, a salient frown captured on his dry lip as he placates his squire on the shore of federal caps but dots below. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    A scholarly and handsome man, futuristic black hair drops on his right eyebrow sharply dressed in dark colors complimenting the environment. Grey slacks pull across narrow legs and pitch him a vague yet fashionable coat hanger resting at a door that catches the draft from outside with it's knitted kites. His fit frame pushes into the cloth in all the right ways, knobby orifices rise as props lifting, stilted rods that in dreams jolt from canvas exposed in fiendishness. He adjust his belt to a comfortable position with instantaneous gratification and allows a sigh to escape. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Retreating from the window William plops on the dark leather upholstery of a therapist chair centered in the room and a firm whiff of air is released from its over engineered cushions dotted with flat buttons. He envisions Sigmund Freud prodding his cranium with eruditious maneuvers, flashing rorschachian images too quickly for any interpretation of significance. Overcome with brief relaxation from the envisionment, fleeting and all but real, freed of the uncomfortable stresses of bureaucracy, the gloomy executive glances downward following thought waves through many unexplored passages. Brought to a jasmine field of sun flower, stems project downward into earth as diverging roots holding musty soil and its riches in tight clumps. A tingling sensation engulfs his body in the stemmy pool, falling to his back and dirtying his shirt flora grows through him with vivacious penetration. The steel croon from the window is left further away, the line between reality and idea indistinguishable. His phone rings from the desk twice before he rises to lift it from its nook. A retrograde black dial-up of antiquity stylishly juxtaposing the surroundings. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    “Mhmm. Yes. Of Course. Certainly. Affirmative. Positively. Okay. Absolutely. Fine. Sure.
I accept.”
                    <br><br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    On a desk two shadows shutter on a lens. Captured someplace in Paris on moss cobble a woman resting under William's arm smirks as if she had somehow possessed knowledge William would be reminded of her in this moment years later without consent. Her face oddly drooping on one side, she stares blankly into the camera, a stolid shape on the jaw. Wrinkles rise and fall indiscriminately on her face, William’s arm tightly hooked through the vice grip clamping angle of her elbow, a grimace of pain evident in the twitching corner of the chained mans lip. There is a sense that the architecture of the women’s visage oddly illuminated in the image is of malleability.  Transiently passing, it seems to have never happened, the frigid hand of the women on his shoulder a consistent thorn firmly inserted into the back, not bothered to acknowledge it in completeness surrounding his every action.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    A dull look stretches Williams face in momentary lapse. Weaving flora on the descending moor no longer in sight he expressionlessly slides toward the door into the hall moving with little speed toward the stairs and down below to the production line; taking extra care to make each step count down the fire escape, each movement is enacted one at a time toward the manager’s office. He canyoneers the spire with jagged steeples complex and endless down to the ground. The passage, surly designed with some intent, folds in unsuspecting ways, the purpose masked in a din of aspirations. Conflicted in streaks of black and white paint, grey exerts its tutelage in the crooked entanglement, a suture at every corner. It seems every movement is circular.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    On the silver workfloor workers tirelessly pedal away in neat single file lines stretching hundreds of yards, sweat pouring from their feverish faces red with blood rushing to cheeks. In the window box above, the manager's office, it is comfortable though William feels an oddness in his gut here. A twisting sensation as though his innards were being pulled from below. The skybox, a tan cargo freight bolted carelessly to the ceiling is of deceptive altitude, such that any one worker by miraculously shifting perspective from the tunnel could view it with a double take in confusion. The workers sing hymns and invent fiction to cleanse the confusion from themselves, an irritating reality circumvented through the arts presented as irrevocable rhetoric punishable by fire. An irritating florid light seems to glow from every direction in the box, making any inhabitant of it blink twice as much than is necessary, perhaps a form of hypnosis persuading those men of the hymns, high in towers, to become disillusioned and forgetful. On Williams left a balding man in a black suit and tie mumbles in slurred whispers staring at the endless rows of red faces
                    <br><br><br>
                    “This quarter's going to be a killer sir, I’ve already filled the ISA for the DBSMT. The dividends seem to be declining with the persistence of a sigmoid function in reverse, so I’ve had the accountants produce a truncheon for the investors, to bolster the market value of the shares. ”
“Rodney, I need to take leave at once, something has come up.”
                    <br><br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The short fat man giggles looking over his shoulder at nothing at all. A sure sign of his understanding. William pats him on the head and whispers sweet nothings in his ear, the man taking every word with unnecessarily overt calculation, he nods uncontrollably in rapid succession at each pause. William leaves making no hesitation to start heading home, the man bows to him as he exits.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Hastening in central station, William sorties from the ivory tower, wrapped in a brown overcoat and traveler’s hat. Passers elbow his arm and the deafening tone of thousands of unheard conversations meld into a single sound knocking at the ear, he sneers in discomfort swinging a briefcase from side to side to avoid damaging civilians. All that they say with dumb expressions and thick dialects seems wasted to him. On an intercom, a tinny announcer recites
                    <br><br><br>
                    “For your safety, do not leave any luggage unattended, please report any suspicious activity to the authorities and have a wonderful day!”
                    <br><br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The crackle makes him nauseous, pulling his attention from the numerous transactions he’d been considering, feeling guilty about the excessive prices to which he succumbed for the purchase of four bust of his father. The artist’s graduate level cubism forced William’s hand, he really had no say in the matter; a glossy disfigured painting of a violinist reminded him of his boy William IV, a struggling musician he hadn’t seen for years and often recalled. Frequently, William admired the boy’s memory, always making certain to keep him in the back of his cloud of thoughts. However, daily activities often forced the idea someplace hidden to him. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Leaning shoulders dipped against a station clock, a disheveled homeless man's beard sprigs downward every way – another in the crowd. He drags on a cigarette pushing a dark smoke from his nostril weezing at the scalding screen. Somewhere in Cuba, in a brightly light cabin, humid in a porous hut, a tan boy with waving black hair pushes tobacco on his father's workbench. Scratches on its surfaces reveal warm brown tones beneath the dusky paint. Noises in the jungle guide his young fingers in the act, the aroma of fried plantains his reward awaiting. The homeless man, leaning on the pole clock, engraved with intricate patterns is unaware. He lies on his side and bathes in the paper occasionally falling to him; paper earned by pedaling red faces feeling sorry. They use the station to return to their lonely homes, cavities in the walls of slate cubes dangling above the freeway, they remove their worn shoes to eat canned peaches behind the static of a television arm in arm with their obese wives. On the rail these faceless persons wade across the grey of the station taking mercurial lunges to cut off William at random intervals. William clinches the wallet in his left pocket untrusting. It seems everyone is in the way. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Snow mounds line the side of the road and the affluent neighborhood is empty. Despite the high standard of living in the metropolis, and the assailable excess to which the people are accustomed, a strange lack of activity persist in its corridors. All but the sound of cars from afar can be heard at any given time, or perhaps the coo of a sparrow, one of the few animals active on the scape. To William, the bends in the road seem to gain ever sharper angles as he passes them, slipping by sycamore trees tired and withering, cineral blotches rise from their bark exposed. In a few more yards he will escape the needling pains of the cold air and retire from the wretched state of winter. Up the grey-green sprinkled yard and black drive is a colonial style house, classical colonnades lift it from earth giving it the face of a regal estate. He stumbles up the steps and something warm spreads, building at the temple as he opens the heavy dark maple door to home he is greeted by particles emboldened by rays cast from the circular window above. By the fireplace visible from the foyer, Frentilda, Williams cook, shuffles about with an armful of ripe avocado. A european looking women, her cragged aquiline nose points toward nothing at all. With motions all implemented  decisively, she mumbles tunes from the old country silently to herself from a greasy voicebox diligently bending the notes. 
                    
                    <br><br><br>
                    “Good day Mr. Dafued! Quite chilly isnit’?”
                    <br><br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Nodding William removes his cap and places it on a burgundy chair right of the doorway. A concerned expression gaining prevalence on him, he wishes Frentilda the same. 
                    The foyer is grand, an elegant glow from an industrial stainless steel chandelier lights the way to a dark purple arm chair situated at a 45 degree angle to the mantle. It is there William reads  Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit gnawing on the butt of a cigar he will never smoke. His home, like his office, effectively asserts an atmosphere of sleek modernism. An array of well-placed Victorian style furniture, amidst modern fixtures instills admiration and desire of those lucky to writhe within the forest green walls. Arela, the women of the photo, has left her coverings on the cement slab before the fireplace, dirtied and torn in several locations he thinks of how long they’ve sat there. It seems these mechanical parts are scattered, appearing at random in all places. Piles of coiled wires and contraptions line the corners of the room amassing in great clumps. Odiously, the discontented CEO limps to the location of his perpetual studies taking extra care to ensure the proper angle to the mantle has not been knocked off kilter by Frentilda’s productive bustling.   
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    William’s rummaged suitcase battered from years of service rest at his hip. He pulls the leather sac open carefully removing a tinted bottle from a hidden pocket within and places it onto the end table. He wonders if the black eye is looking out for him ensuring the day to day doings of queens is not without turmoil. With shaking hands, taking extra care to only dispense the proper amount onto his pink tongue, William doses himself with the precision of a pedantic chemist. The action taken with the robotic prowess of a man of refined muscle memory, the tired actions are insignificant to him, a pallid stretch of congealed limb outward. Tiredly he awaits, the orange tips of flame mesmerize and are followed by a euphoric rush contaminating his nostrils stinging in blunt pin pricks. Outside the world fades away, the warmth of the fire beneath the mantle leaving him dazed. With sleepy sight he observes the pillars of the foyer ballooning outward toward the ceiling transformed into the structural underbelly of a medieval crypt keeping the castle from tumbling onto the village. The very foundation lifting the estate becoming abstracted, only identified from the crucible of objects by meticulous observation, the things here seem to coalesce with inseparability. Sloppily William wanders his thoughts, recalling all the important transactions of the days, months, and years; he thinks of his importance and all that he has produced, all that now floats within the glowing fluid alloys of the estate with jasmine hue boiling over. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    In the corner of the grand foyer a serrated harp rest, its wooden borders coated in dust, its long strings crackled and ruddy. William moves within the nebulous of thought, looking for The Fourth, somewhere it is there, harder and harder to find William relies on incantations to find it. He faces the European, her movements now frivolous producing little yield, maybe she can answer the questions he looks for
                    <br><br><br>
                    “Frentilda, be so kind as to dust the harp would you.”
                    <br><br><br>
                    “Certainly sir, it would be my pleasure.”
                    <br><br><br>
                    “Tell me Frentilda, it is here you toil, wiping, scrubbing, and otherwise passing the hours. Can you imagine more Frentilda? And if you can, if you question it, if the thoughts bubble in your mind, you lie on your cot and think of this and that. To troubled to sleep and to well fed to dream, does it have a head, or a tail, or even an outline?”
                    <br><br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    William loosely shifts beyond the densities collected at the bottom. He wanders obscurity and climbs to its surface. Beyond the entrance a pumping machine hisses but in the hall it is nearly silent. In the room just beyond William a blue cable slides into it, carmine fluids dripping through lubrication, the notches in the spine black and crooked. A flush face drastically contorted, odd geometry in the bone, she has progressed to what William can accept as a last form. Pistons clank to an incongruous cadence, unmetered and non-symmetric. Various sharp edges protrude at odd dimensions from it threatening those who dare to approach. Hasty globs of weld blotted all about from perfunctory repairs, a coal soot dirtying the air from its exhaust. William steps carefully into the steel plated room. Fondly, William remembers paddling to the center of an uninhabited lake, a splintered oar resting in his grip drawing blood from the palm while reeds swayed to summer’s breeze. A women grinning ear to ear in the blue green, he can’t remember her face, but most certainly her smile, and their fat orange cat looking into the distance. He remembers throwing a rusted ten pound anchor off the side and watching the rope disappear into black and thinking of how still time was at that very moment, how he was briefly caught in something poorly explained by anything he’d ever read or heard, how the world he believe to be so overpopulated, gluttonous, and non-critical, could simultaneously be empty and gentle. His hand over her xylophonic ribs and vitals slowing, they rolled the boat into the vast open. Now William is tired, he feels the bags form under his eyes with each passing winter’s day falling like molasses into a null dreamless sleep. There seems to be no conclusion to the cacophony, only a sea of empty skies, and the odd metallic heart before him.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Landscapes are never captured well on bad cameras by uneducated photographers. Days after, looking at the photos I've taken, leaning on them as a physical retention of a brief moment, I'm left with a flattened resemblance. There is a decrease in the potency of what during experience was a visual stimulant, and I think it has to do with perspective and a picture's lack of texture. <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;That tangent aside, I'm quite surprised how well everything went. I have never been solo backpacking before and things went without a snag. The drive was fine, the hike was enjoyable, and the drive home was fine - a three step process. It's really spooky how fine things were, especially considering the certain anxiety I had before making a sporadic decision to purchase 700 dollars worth of ultralight hiking gear and go wander 25 miles in the woods. But I'll be damned if it wasn't anything but therapeutic and mildly challenging. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing particularly interesting happened. It rained the first night, the birds chirped, the butterflies flew, and my back hurt a little. Nevertheless as I wavered deeper into the experience, and the world of rattling highways left my mind, as my thought became blank and my body a machine built to push forward, I attained a supersense of myself and the barren dunes around, knowing my sloven meatbag as it rolled down the sands to be an akward attachment to me. What ensued is best described as a dissociative experience, not in the sense of leaving, rather collapsing into a single point.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Though fleeting, as cruel time tends to do to itself and us in it, for these times in the dunes, woods, archipelagos, and beaches I was alone in the world; not in the way of loneliness, not in the way we feel bound to a place or person unfree, in a way I find myself trapped by the realities that so persistently remind me of them, of alimentation real and imagined, rational and irrational, not melancholy or joyous, but a blank alone, a peaceful solitude of my reality and mentality. I was not worried of any vanity, any prickling trifle so abundant in normal life, I was not even strung on the inconsistent comforts which are clung to in everyday life - I was a panting animal, challenged and plain. While occurring it was not spectacular nor a forefront of thought, as I became a singular thing without a body or mind, just a breath on the breeze. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;How easy it is to abandon prosaic disposition and recline into poetic indulgence. Not two paragraphs prior and 12 hours earlier I am quoted, "Nothing particularly interesting happened", and somehow I've warped that negation, that nothing interesting into something interesting. This is why I am attracted to minimalism - in a spinning world a purity of plainness becomes exotic, a soothing spice tricking the tongue to its misunderstood sleights. The question is then with this new found like - is it sustainable? As it is moving away from me in time, I grow fond to reach it, whereas during its impact, it was inconsequential, meaningless if not enjoyable. Its effects are unnoticeable now, blunted by carbon monoxide fumes at the intersection, only inaccurate re-creations in my synapses. (See pic below for flat image of dismal synapses)

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;When I doggedly trudged the final miles to my car Tuesday night, and sit here today Friday with an uncertain malaise, a fatalistic haunting, what can I really take from experience? What’s really left from these periods? A photograph, a false aphorism to grasp, a re-creation from language of the ineffable? Or am I forever trapped in the present, the only reliable thing to manipulate justly, the only thing I can hope to understand, the only thing in which I can once again become a panting animal plain and free.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;By night we are meant for reasons expressed recalls Hemsworth peering to the avenue, his purple coat at a ninety and beyond toward the highway. An incarcerated hand checking the tan wall out of line, alkaline, not in the hand but with elbow filled tendinitis. The thinness of the pane rattling to his windy expectations brings recollection of the day. A lovely day had by all accord, and one to be had, light breeze gesture, flakes there past the nostril huffing, blooms of cloud bound to whisker, the tonsured measure of kind, blackened soot. Persons estranged here and to all with some sight, trite, inconvenient and all, but nonetheless alike. Frowns under ipsum lorem newspaper colitis unbenounced to the murky clay hill over, scenic as is but far beyond grasp and liable to slug handed fumbling. Sticky steps unelicited, ill tempered pestilence up college avenue amid to lilac quintessence under the gums. A steel taste throat coat by means of self doing tooth by tooth.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;So, no reasonable step can be made thought Hemsworth unbent in expedition pressing the seam of his pant not to split. He lifts a pick from his drawer and latches it to a gap then forming splintered mouth wood to fumble on the glum tongue. Unenthusiastic tearing merely, more an activity than a habit, those smokers out and around would agree had the nicotine worn thin and sensation returned to fractious temples. Unlucky however to be of the same meaning is Hemsworth, our frail protagonist plight, steady reorientation needs to be mandated. A danzon to struggle by, not flagrant inattention but a measured reformation to attend – one evening to be outgoing and rub elbows with strangers.  With such an intention, clank the drawer table screeches unattentive to handling by the cretin, the cordial procedure Hemsworth and the drawer rehearse in repitition.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;On the ivory tower of high accomplishment, surly recognized by pedestrians on the lane to which he looks confronted not by the paper shrine at the wall, master of psychology naught, but as a clueless observer on the heavenfield. Now in opposition to his vibrations at point, feeling liminal at times, absent others, sifting altogether by minutless brinery, but a pickled fool confided by preservatory maneuver again, again. Nonesuch a green, experienced in the ache of foot soles but helplessly prone to their struggle. A green becomes red from bludgeoning. Often a callous is thought to form but contrarily a tender sole bends at whim to insistent pebbles goading their layer. Soon as opposed to later these pebbles accrue into a rocky rampart protecting the foot.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;So left with the empty room to entertain – if only beyond the door there were abolishment of misdeed. Time ago, withered from a storms will, writhing floor tremble, the mind can escape itself to see. Friendly faces and egos on the weed grounds coarse in friction but heat desired, silk touch psalms: moretoo clutch calm hand thirsting. In rebuttal to previous encounter today Hemsworth listened to speakers, queried those there about, plucked on about weather, but nonetheless afforded no more value than an ink page blotter. A rorschachian blotch amorphous on the sheet, an octopuses bed sheet milky black inept for recovery on dry land knocking hamfisted all fixtures and utterly attached by the utter to all in contact. Each vessel suctioned, Hemsworth a conglomerate lost in them perhaps altogether overcome without oxygen in the blob of objects. A trophy of a man performing sport, the various mugs from the cheap laminated wood cupboard, the container for carrying his coffee oil which in bright mornings slips down the throat in a ghazal bringing the lonesome elation all efforts are anchored to, the forked steel firmly latched in the sea cave. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The small room small behind the window and drawer, unhomely not beautiful. Flinch there by the dresser, lean by the light glowing ornament gleaned out from night at a touch. Sensations had for some time to recover from blight beside a drying river. As a child Hemsworth walked it with Christian an ungodly child, a must in the trench – in the cracks cheered on by antiquated sponge soft for fluid or lack thereof. Under their lean-to huddled with the smirk of archaics they shared secrets off featherless egrets multiplyless by tree thin shadows. Huddled in solidarity against the buzzing from endless development beyond the 200 foot forest expanse they were secluded in shades of beige. A vestigial curtain suppressing the anguishes of modernity, two boys fiendish and intentful. Now years after, a decade nearly, only lying sideways on the drying rack accomplishes some semblance of release. The steam burns the nostrils in the sauna in a tolerable way accounting for its analgesic maneuver. To fend off sleep lifting from the pores only tan pines harshly remind Hemsworth of the small swath back home. As a young adult fleeing to the birch tree island northward lacked the same effect. Dizzy on the pine, kearnles of dirt digging into the side, thinking these thoughts, Hemsworth in the strange state wishes she had taken him with her there. A distant friend black haired and wild eyed reckless, but unlike most acutely in tune with Hemsworths orientation. Critical to the illegitimacy of being without falter. He slinks his arm down from the elevated pine tactically numb to the procession. The arm extends from lack of fluid.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Black moss in the damp crevasse, the worried protagonist sullies at the health sapping dampness. Unbenounced to him the green fingers clouting the rocks of the ditch multiply unobserved more or less the way they should. Had any other ideal been more prevalent certainly they would prevail in the slit. Inequally morphing and tense at the edges, the ground moves his steps forward without consultation. An independent actor to be sure, the day before P had reconciled the fact of his responsibility in the action. An illustrious conjurer himself deceiving the lawyers and nagging spouses not at all presently present. In addition, enduring the unique predicament set ahead, the earth growls of hunger. Unsure of the direction into or out from he scratches the scraggle on his face now smooth and unvitiated as moments before he had grabbed a hand grizzled by the unforgiving winds of the north and felt a dull pain on his shoulder alike to that of a chilling electric drill on tooth. Unable to turn his head to inspect the culvert with only these fragmented thoughts to garnish his rationale he forms. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;But asudden, no longer does the protagonist gain footing here and swirls down or up a gaseous soldier. Exiting promptly out the narrow canyon what could remain devoid of the protagonist? An antagonist must surely be awaiting further down and the currents are as predictable as ever shifting the vessel to collide with the graveled banks. From time to time the wind crashes the rippled water in a thunderous collision with its barriers and the husk believes it to be a feeling. An antiquated zealous held by the ancients deep in their brittle bones now chips constituting the stars and canyon of voyage. A fleshy silk froths from the waters and growing a spine the husk trembles in its goodness, faithfully asserting itself to be a marauding captain demanding of the sea what ought to be a possession, its movement. Untamed currents however needn’t be the vessel of possession as sea froth a sludge clouds them at whim and culpable to none - neither a gaseous soldier nor the heaven above, but the unintelligible whirl of breeze indolently pulsating. Vital without clarity to attach itself, ethereal and seamless, a rigid lattice canvas, he is blank and dually colorful.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;P the figurine settled on the landscape beach insist to be absolved and pushes forward at the temple toward the clouded sky's unforgiving menace sinking down onto granite sand tight in his sneaker, withering footware grasping his heel raw to tender pokes keel, the rocks dislodged from the organ.

                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to common thought, or typical ongoingness of the daily, or of imperceptible unattention and attenuation of the subtleties cloaking the surroundings of our most automatic automations, alienated oddities needn't amass at the forefront of thought. A single tracked tessellation, not of some malign variety, but gravitationally grounded in ruts to be overcome not so simply. Feeling is inextricably inundated by multiple threads of the same pattern, persistently and without penance. Patterns which govern compulsory behavior, a categorization of universal coverage, behavior begot from the behavior of the day before in logical chain. Except on rare occasion, exposed to forces pushing the player from its path, peat paced platitudes are ineffective as a method to exit ruts orbit pattern.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;P's aside, following the tail of my own inability to break pattern, except by violent transaction at odds with automations, taking observation and motivating action mostly fails, activism unattainable. Cold feet is what many would claim, commitment a difficult maneuver if not automatic, an impermeable barrier blanketing the object of reorientation. Reluctantly as a catatonic on the matter, a matter for which I cannot speak, abstract as it is, pacing its edges only to attain an olfactory sense, the cloak covering this freedom has kevlar durability, not wounded by feeble confabulations of an aimless author. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Movement is impossible in the perspective portrayed, but a surf in the serfdom shackled scantily to the cloaked kevlar object objectively. An artist beholden to it, foolishly feeling it as it may be, but is not. Aware of the fallibility of its own senses the animal is openly accepting of its minisculity, but all tinged false, the aimless author loses motivation. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The Myth of Sysiphus, a myth of a myth entailing, awakened to the skepticism which I the author am grounded. If some omniscient oracle is free of this cognition, freely handling the visage sheet I round and can remove it - assuming it is an enclosed space and not infinite, indolence not an obstacle to the oracle, it could plunge without leap into it. Without action, the oracle is the space and the space the oracle. Akashic records with cognitive capacity, not simply an existence, a platonic mass with no volition beholden to physics, but a free standing stolid, discriminating the information as its physical and hyperphysical embodiment and disembodiment. No presence of it invisible, inaccurate, or without explanation.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Even devoid of further stimulus, nothing in the this world new or foreign for the author to detail and dissect, I am confronted with infinite detail within, where mirth and misery lie in wait. A simultaneous prison and picnic, pleasantries and exorcism clamor, congealing to be broken yet too flow outwardly, an omenary inelegance refactored to fit as ostentation. Not worthwhile, streams are insistently rethought or ignored in writings wrought with repetitions and rattlings.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The task is improbable to unravel at the merristem for I am pithless. To unwind from the suppressing wrap which strangles my intuition - leaving a distracted diatribe drab. With diligence, a hopeful emissary may emerge, but etiolated is the wrapped manic leaving little help.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Many write from a place of strength, a passionate platform, a feeling of the components forming the places they see, hear, and smell. For good reason, in need of a volition a writer is: it is their fuel for a clunking piston driving oily language from them. Sickly and salubrious crudity, times incoherent but always humanly. There is a bond between the person and their idea, what they are to themselves, what they are to others whom are what they are to themselves. Defendants to a vitality which is involuntarily theirs, an instinctive possession, an ugly emotion. So to claim that I wish to detach myself from myself, to abandon the ugly feelings motivating me, desires and motives, I encounter a tricky procedure for which I am equipped but a brittle tool in nothingness. As a living thing, immersed in myself and the world felt around it - often falsely and illusory, only peripherally interacting with other selves, but always firmly within itself of selves, the only thing which I contain that may be unattached is the ability of nothing. To cleanly leave without remnant from the conscious and body to escape the carry of weight is to take stance on nothing. Philosophically this is troubling, without myself to stand on, from what could a voice emanate, from where? What can be made of nothingness, what can be done stripping from myself the multiplicity uncleanly mixed into me.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;It is insane, for the self to so plainly dream of being the unself. A self that at least to some degree understands itself. A chameleon self which even in this writing is beginning to sound like Gertrude Stein, which it read briefly and clung to - itself? And it commutes impassionality, makes the desperate attempt to connect with another which always fails or is temporally limited, leaving all isolated again defeated always. Even in the throes of connection we are driven back to ourselves craving it - always skeeved by the foreignness on the other side. Thus, to leave is to be lost, no doubt a danger. Can it cope with such a danger? Could the chameleon self terminate and if it did what is leaving its walls? A husk? A crusty rationale lost in a mechanical silhouette projected from others. A passionless murdering rationale without vomit, tears, or pain to fear - no concept of head or tail other than the logical connection of them. That which forms the connection invisible, the magical thing that brings to me a twinkle, why would I abandon it, leave it floundered and dried on the dissecting table, a rusty nothingness scalpel firmly gripped by the cog rationale unshaken? The good that it would do to be lost in such a place, flat without rolling hills to climb and fall from, somehow desirable.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;It is what it wants more than all, to escape its bottle and never return, even well aware of the effectiveness running serves as a coping mechanism. To run in this case must be confrontational, as running is to pull away and break. Perhaps breaking will not accomplish much, as damage across the self radiates as a heat, starting in the bowles and moving to the corners of outwardness: the eyes and face. And to break the chameleon would be to pretend that it is self contained, although superficially tied to others. It would also be to pretend that it is well understood rather than vacillating, running and retreating upstream, downstream, sidestream - an enigmatic contradictory ego death. Can’t be reached, not even marginally. What is a chameleon in nothing? What is chameleon in contact with many chameleons? What does a chameleon know of itself and other chameleons, a serrated battalion of them on the gray city street, faceless passers, vagrants, a rail of them jostled, no words for one another? What is a chameleon without words to tell of others and themselves?

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe what is at stake is a notion of identity, that I or anyone else is anything more than carefully crafted pile of experience rather than strange fowl growths from the green gray field, fleshy and awful. Mealy, selfish actuators to kill without caution, remorse a faint blue dye amidst pooling liquid preservation. Transparent otherwise but clouded by emotion ultimately insignificant to it. Deranged scoundrels on the pavement, built high on morals and accepted narratives, thick skulled superstitions, twirled around the wind to spit preaches at pions, unprepared for deviations, stumble and be stubborn. I, the chameleon is wrong because I nor you can be right.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;A weeping valve bubbles with vapor, its tin slider glued handy on the clinch, tapered to leak, a fusible linkage. It picks its teeth with a tool, grits its greens to a gum, palpable. Picturesque contraption, an oracle, its shined metal slithery silver, notched for cooling capacity - a velocity about it unmatched admirable. Meniscus broth from the outtake spigot, covering its plate of bolts it shakes to coat, now prepared for the further deviation a crooked stale dinner for one. A tinseled taciturn, shakes at the joint in action, coxing the relation between their and then thus. A jarring smoothness to direction, gully lever heap, heaving dead finch thing pulling together subjects. The lusterless frontiersmen structuring entelechy - green haired gizmo, fecund with grease zerks flattened for non snag. Does the danzon, dangles at the ditch, moonless gold grease and handles the dilemma, bring about its ends from its means, a simple knot, pull through the center the threads, pull mechanically and bitterly.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;To produce the surgery the lines of lesions must be met. The invention, undoubtedly and contradictorily one with the patient, an autoperation, must act harmful to the partial actor by necessity, while actualizing the yearning intention. A careful separation of pieces filling the collage, mingled together inseparable but vulnerable to gizmos linear slice - it clicks along the path of incision carefully separating the tissues which lift from their owner in slabs of flesh. An ethereal glaze speckles on the slabs and spreads its infection, a glinting membrane across the connections piecing the cadaver through and through, their essence imaginative and reactionary - unprocessed varieties of flavour which scent the pieces of multiplicity where ends meet the becomings with seamless integration. An ornate fluency between these devotions, they syncopate themselve individually but symphonically to the greater flowing flux, and arrive a circular unrounded glitter pulp at the edge of gizmo's syringe extraction device ephemerally. Haphazard hemoglobin hippies constituting the emotive body wiped from the metallic surface gizmo cleans - gizmo glistens and listens. No screech nor terror in the emotive stew surgery bag, no joyous jubilation, gaiety, grandiosity imaginative colorful things to push to the world - truly an eerie peace, but now lacking the appreciative capacity it held to experience such a thing.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The grey boolean bricks line gizmo's wall and the dense skolemization of objects in the bottle from outside weigh heavy. No longer existential but perfectly instantiated on the stage are props and properties thereof. The jigsaw puzzle complete, no inaccurate edges to understand, a completion accompanied by lack of appreciation. Anhedonistic speculation unnecessary, the connections appherient and unavoidable, the mysterious waxing of the once opaque without varnish. Verisimilitude takes a new meaning, a lusterless shimmering. The gizmo always apart of the being, now freed of the second guessing forced on it by uncertain methodologies of hypothesis, clarity a pleasant side effect, but with no pleasant receptacle to receive it. The world gray, but only gray in the sense of (220,220,220), has no effect on the gizmo's way of reason. A complete homeostasis unachievable by the living or those present in nature, Gizmo presides as the penultimate order of all in a blank, passionless, authoritarianism - delegating possibilities and actualities with unmissable precision, no disorder.
